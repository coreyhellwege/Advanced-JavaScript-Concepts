# Functional Programming

Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared with methods in objects.

## Pure Functions

If you want to break things down in functional programming it all comes down to this concept of pure functions. The idea is that there's a separation between data over a program and the behavior of a program. All objects created in functional programming are immutable, so after it has been created it cannot be changed.

Rules:

- The function has to always return the same output, given the same input
- The function cannot modify anything outside of itself
- No side effects

<i>Example:</i>

```javascript
const array = [1,2,3] // in the outside world (don't modify)

function removeLastItem(arr) {
    const newArray = [].concat(arr); // make a copy of the input instead of directly modifying it
    newArray.pop()
    return newArray
}

function multiplyByTwo(arr) {
    return arr.map(item => item * 2) // using .map() will return a new array
}

const array2 = removeLastItem(array);
const array3 = multiplyByTwo(array);

console.log(array, array2, array3) // -> Â [1, 2, 3] , [1, 2] , [2, 4, 6]
```
